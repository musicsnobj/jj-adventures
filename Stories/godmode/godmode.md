#### sat, 7/3
greg locke
i keep wanting to rabbit-hole into the technology we're introducing here
  but that's the problem i've been falling into repeatedly
stories are about characters, conflicts
  let that dictate what the technology needs to be

greg locke
law enforcement
married high school sweetheart
  raised two girls
man of faith
good case worker

as i'm trying to bring locke to life, i should maybe stop referring to him as locke
  i should refer to him as me
step into the shoes of this man
be him as he sorts thru his thoughts
  like how i do soc-style
    but as someone else

#### sun, 7/4

i am the hero
i am greg locke
  what's on my mind
i don't want to get divorced
my babe
  my wife of 18 yrs
i'm not religious
i'm an ethnic mutt, hence the name locke
raised catholic
  fell away from church
why do i like trump
wait no i didn't fall away from the church, the wife was the one making me go
  that's the one silver lining, no more boring church

stream of conscious
he's got a brash way of talking but i find it refreshing
  he speaks plainly, that's rare in a politician
and i like that he's not afraid to talk about all the corruption in the deep state
  we always knew there was a lot more going on than they were saying
    but until now, the president was always a product of the deep state
every once in a while someone needs to come in and clean house
  i think he's done a lot to purge the deep state
    even as they're throwing all these witch hunt investigations at him

the great derangement

locke keeps going off the books, following leads based on qanon posts
  nothing to do w/ his case assignments
he thinks he's on the verge of exposing the whole satanic pedophile operation


things were finally going well for me when tallulah barged into my life
she came out of nowhere. what reason would i have to even pay attention to the next kook who sets up a fortune-telling operation in my town?
as far as i was concerned she could summon her spirits and sell grieving families on the comfort and eternal happiness of their loved ones, assure lonely housewives a new romantic rebirth was just over the horizon. so long as she had the right permits, so she was not my concern.

something $liberty says
$liberty = locke's now ex-wife

just one thing i wanna know...
g: why tell her i was addicted to my job
  why not just say i was cheating? or something that would make it super easy for her?
t: i don't dictate what the visions show me mister locke

need to figure out what the interface looks like b/w tallulah and the technology
  how does she learn about an individual

she can see their minute-by-minute vital signs. blood pressure, heart rate, etc
  but how does she know things like political preference, fears, wants, etc
the map of a user's connectome is being constantly updated in the cloud
plenty of medical reasons for the $device to track that info
$device = the cutting edge huawei medical implant marketed as the "cure for death"

they say data is the new gold, and china is the new saudi arabia

locke figures out tallulah's hiding something
not the extent of it, of course

we (the audience) don't suspect the medical implant at first
  (at least we're not meant to, unless we're particularly astute. trying to build a compelling twist here)
what do we suspect...

trump makes a shady deal w/ chinese president xi which exposes a ton of personal data to huawei
  xi promised they could then harness the technology to secure a 2020 victory for the president

i'm waffling b/w two options for the "good" politician:
  - he's a republican incumbent senator who refuses to fall in line behind trump, and trump throws all his support behind a more maga-friendly challenger
  - he's an everyman compelled to challenge the maga-friendly republican incumbent in the upcoming primary, and trump throws his support behind the incumbent


#### mon, 7/5

this story is high concept
i have to stop trying to shrink it down
  it's big
    it's clever
  the consequences are major
    and not all that unrealistic
the chinese communist party is the main, ultimate "bad guy"
  the story's not "about" them per se, in the same way my cousin vinny isn't about the guys who actually shot the sac'o'suds clerk, but the story wouldn't have happened without them
they're the ones with the plan
the ultimate experiment
designed and executed by huawei
they spent decades developing the cure for human death
  now they get to work on the cure for human behavior
the us-them, groupishness that's pitted races, civilizations against each other since the beginning
with access to all that medical data
  their nanobots literally mapping and re-mapping our brains with the forming of each new memory
    a structure appears in our connectone representing a new piece of information -> a digital copy of it appears on huawei's servers within nanoseconds
this implant
  the pill we all swallowed
    that saved our lives
  and embedded its
grabbed ahold of our genome
  the blueprint of our very identity
and changed it
  applied patches of code
    turning our cells into little unix operating systems
      the upgrade we always wanted
  with an army of nanos reporting your blood sugar levels and another army standing by with a hit of insulin, diabetics could finally live a life every bit as normal as the rest of us
  and cancer? forget early detection. these nanos are constantly checking your every cell against a repository of every type of cancer cell known to man. when it gets a hit, the nanos assemble a perfect team of assassins
  like that supercomputer that beat garry kasparov by analyzing the board against every known position in the history of tournament chess
    

  the cancer fatality rate among our user base remains at zero since the product hit the market

(starting to think jian for the)

i can see the villain making speeches like:
```
what we gave the world with the gift of mana was extraordinary
  but like every game-changing technology, many industries were disrupted
    ironically the end of cancer meant a lot of ppl would go hungry
  big pharma suffered when the wellspring of profits from aids medications went dry

a lot of ppl went hungry
  fingers were pointed
    leaders changed
  but nobody made the argument that we should reintroduce this weakness to humanity just so those industries which fed on that weakness could survive
eliminating the single-gene mutation diseases was super easy
  diabetes was more tricky

the first design involved embedding nanos in both the circulatory and digestive systems and have them talk to each other, blood sugar too low, trigger a hit of artificial insulin
  but where does the insulin come from
    so we got really ambitious and designed this artificial sac full of insulin-producing nano cells
  until one of our guys came in and just drew a big line across half the blackboard, cutting out everything but the nano cells
    and he was right. there was no need for a whole complex monitoring system if our nanos can simply build cells that produce insulin like any normal beta cell in a non-diabetes-sufferer
  see we try not to reinvent the wheel
    when possible we'll harness the body's existing mechanisms


i'm doing this, mr locke, because i want humanity to win. do you?


the next challenge, figuring out how to embed transmitters nanos in the circulatory system, and an
```

smells. a powerful bit of info tallulah's code allows her to use are scents from a person's past that trigger specific memories
  like in black mirror crocodile


lauren's psychopathy somehow makes her impervious to the experiments $badGuy is running
  because of how their brains process the chemicals
    releasing extra chemicals to reinforce behavior does nothing in her case




the official advice from public health experts re: the developing threat of this hybrid cyber/bio attack from china is if things become heated when engaging with your fellow man, try to pause for a moment and shift attention to something the two of you have in common
  a politically neutral group you're both part of
    perhaps a sports team or band you both like
the situation calls for a temporary restriction on freedom of speech, especially as it applies to clothing/brand representation
no memorabilia associated with hate groups
more controversially, nothing that "clearly identifies" one's political identity
  i.e. no vagina hats, and no maga hats
  even more to trump's chagrin, ppl are forbidden from gathering in large groups


demonstrating critical thinking is equivalent to proving we have free will
  the story is about free will
    and the lesson is we DO have it
      or at least it's useful to behave like we do
  like that thing lulu miller's dad always said (pp)
```
it's true, everything's meaningless and nothing matters, including you. other people don't matter either, but you should treat them like they do
```

maybe trump doesn't have to be trump after all
he's just a president some ~30yrs down the road with a similarly unconventional rise to power ==I like this idea==
  but his appearance on the nat'l stage was truly a product of his competence
    maybe he's modeled after andrew yang
  he's smart, capable and intends to do right by the american ppl
but when $badGuy bumps up his oxytocin, he starts behaving like trump

no i think we keep the president a sociopath
  so he, like lauren, is not affected by $badGuy's "extra oxytocin experiment"
the message being the cognitive 

$huawei, like boeing in america, is in a position where no one else does what they do at their level, thus any attempt at gov't regulation of their technology is a joke


the departed
there's a plant inside the wh from the left
  oxytocin dialed up sees what he wants
there's a plant from the other side inside the wh w/ a diff mission
  sees the "truth" of the satanic pedophile ring

#### tues, 7/6

the ultimate solution is
  you're born with allegiance to your family/tribe/group
    you shed that allegiance in your lifetime
      and put on an allegiance to humanity
	  

#### wed, 7/7

the media is involved from the beginning
  locke is a cop, a detective, case worker
he's interrogating a suspect
  the last known contact of a recently missing girl
  trying to flip him for what he knows
there's a shadow organization
  operating under the radar
    locke suspects the organization is a local branch of the global syndicate of satanic pedophiles
this guy could maybe get him inside the organization


thinking of using
  rhapsody on a theme of paganini as a template for the story
each movement is a scene

scene one
locke comes home

  thinking it's a normal day

but his wife has packed her things
  and written a long note she's left on the bed

she had expected to be gone before he arrivred
so she's in a hurry to get out
read the note she says
you know i can't argue with you

what if i have questions and the note doesn't have the answers

story starts to take shape when he starts losing sleep over a case
  the missing girl
he wakes up in a haze
  and reads an article forwarded by his brother
    missing children tied to x conspiracy
