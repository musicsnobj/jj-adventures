### setting
USS Tennessee (SSBN-734), a ballistic missile sub somewhere off the coast of portugal. 

Just 580 feet above Hurricane Gamma rips across the Atlantic, but this stealth vessel, captained by the confident and capable Cmdr Steve Isabell, glides safely below the surface, engines answering "all ahead full" toward their home port of King's Bay, GA.

### beats
The spirit on the boat is casual. They're on the home stretch following a patrol mission. Out of nowhere, an order to change course comes in from DoD.

The captain presumes it's a hurricane-related rescue mission. He redirects course per the order.

Upon arrival, a second order comes in from the DoD which alarms everyone in $maneuvering (todo: figure out what the command center is called). Missile launch orders. Complete with the presidential codes they need to fire up the nukes.

Isabell puts it together. The president has ordered him to nuke a hurricane. He's a man of honor. He refuses the order by way of inaction, tho he has no way to verbally do so at their depth and they can't deploy a bouy to the surface for a better signal because there's a hurricane up there

Another order comes in from DoD, same instructions, slightly different coordinates. They must be tracking the movement of the storm and when it stalls they send new missile launch orders with new coordinates. Isabell, increasingly agitated, refuses them all.

Isabell (or a clever side character) deduces from the orders which direction the storm is headed, and orders full speed in the opposite direction where they can surface and have two-way communication.

They surface and establish comms with the Situation Room, where the president, the acting Sec of Defense, Nat'l Security Advisor, Sec of Energy, are all there. President is furious that this captain has defied his order, and also that he came to the surface and transmitted to DC which gives away the Tennessee's position (Operation Nuke Hurricane is supposed to be a super covert op)

"This is You have your orders, yes? From the president? Are they not clear enough?"
"I understand the order sir, but as the captain of this vessel, and especially being in a position of releasing weapons of such an apocalyptical nature, I am permitted to question the lawfulness of such an order."
"The order is from the president, captain. He was briefed on all possible courses, and this is the one he picked. The Tennessee is the only nuke-ready sub close enough to the storm. That's why it's you. Any other questions? We're really up against the clock here."
"Yes, goddammit! We don't train for this kind of missile launch. Where am I even aiming? How do I know when to detonate? What's supposed to happen?"
Sec of Energy flings one of his interns forward to answer the question...
"If you detonate a 5 megaton nuclear warhead in the eye near the base of a hurricane, all that hot air that allows it to keep spinning gets blasted out. Replacing that much hot air with cooler denser air in such a short time should slow the hurricane down to where it will fizzle out before it hits our shores."
"But it's the word *should* that's hurting my head, Mr. Secretary. If we do this, detonate a nuclear warhead inside a hurricane, what happens next could undermine our national standing on all things nuclear. We're talking the most embarrassing international nuclear incident of all time, mobile Chernobyl."

Isabell hears commotion in the background, he recognizes the president's voice as he takes over the conversation...

"You don't even get it. This is a covert operation! There are no guidelines to worry about because no one ever hears about it. Got it? And I know about the guidelines. My people, I have the best people, they told me all about the guidelines, no one knows them better than me. Believe me."
"But Mr. President, is the risk—"
"No no listen, listen captain...Isabell. You don't ask, you don't have to ask us anything, you have one job—"
"Let the captain ask his questions" another voice chimed in from the table.
"Erklin, what is it week two of your tenure as my defense secretary and you've got opinions already? Maybe you should spend some time listening first."
"Meaning no disrespect, Mr. President, captain Isabell served with me in $somePastConflict, he's no dummy. We're putting him in a tough spot, I'd like to hear his concerns."
"There you have it, your old war buddy wants to hear your concerns, Isabell. I thought he was stronger than that, but apparently not. Please tell me, captain, how can I possibly make your mission more clear to you?"

"Why?"

"For protection. For the American people. You saw what happened in Puerto Rico, that was horrible, all the flooding and the trees blown over and the boats just thrown all around the place. They say this Gamma, this big wet storm full of water, is heading to Florida, and I don't know if you've been to the Florida coast but there are all these beautiful golf courses and hotels and boats owned by some very nice people, and I'd just hate to see, and jobs, too. Golf courses and resorts create jobs. And I'm trying to save jobs."
