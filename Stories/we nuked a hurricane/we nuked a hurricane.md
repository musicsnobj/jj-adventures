## synopsis
With Hurricane Gamma ripping across the Atlantic, threatening to unleash nature's fury on the Florida coast, T____ goes to the final play in the playbook: "nuke the son-of-a-bitch"

The top secret stealth operation is partially successful, as the storm appears to spin off course in a trajectory similar to what the experts predicted, but their calculations were off. The hurricane merely took an alternate, equally devastating path.
No way T____ was gonna claim credit. The media coverage was already horrible.
