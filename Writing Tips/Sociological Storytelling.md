[sociological storytelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCsCq4Qo9P4)

Distinct from psychological storytelling in that the characters we follow are _institutions_, not individuals.

The video points to Isaac Asimov’s [foundation series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series) as an example.

Other sociological stories: *The Wire*, *Game of Thrones*, *The Big Short*

I think the video helped me understand why GoT was able to kill off central characters w/o losing viewers.
We’re invested in the *institution* Westoros. That’s the story we care about. Who will win the Game of Thrones.
