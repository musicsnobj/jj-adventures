Notes from the book *Making a Scene* by Jordan Rosenfield

## FIRST SCENE
#### key elements of a first scene
- significant situation that challenges hero’s status quo
- catalyst with whom hero can interact
- quick introduction to protagonist’s immediate intentions
- glimpse of hero’s personal history and personality (which should shed further light on her motivation)
- course of action or decision by hero that immediately leads to more complications

#### how to end the first scene
- leave the consequences of the significant situation unresolved
- end the scene before the hero makes a major decision
- let hero have a disturbing realization that ultimately changes everything in her life
- let hero have a knee-jerk reaction to the significant situation

## SUSPENSE SCENE
#### key elements of a suspense scene
- should come after a contemplative or dialogue-driven scene
- should drive characters toward big conclusions and realizations

#### to create suspense in a scene
- introduce catalyst or antagonist whose intentions seem suspect
- allow hero to feel threatened or pressured by another character or event, and to resist the ensuing demand/request
- allow hero, under pressure, to react or act out in a way that causes unexpected conflict

## DRAMATIC SCENE
The goal is to elicit feelings in the _reader_—not show off the emotional range of the characters
- focus on emotional intensity
- emphasis on relationship-oriented interactions (deepening connections, severing ties b/w characters)
- actions that facilitate hero’s inner life or self-awareness
- indicate that the hero (and thus the plot) is approaching a turning point

#### pacing in a dramatic scene
- start slow. exposition, setting details, inner monologue
- speed up to match rising emotional intensity. replace inner monologue/exposition w/ dialogue/quick actions
- slow down for reflection. return to inner monologue/exposition

#### open a dramatic scene with
- small actions
- a sense of foreboding
- an emotional intention for the hero
- interaction b/w hero and at least one other character
- interaction b/w hero and some larger force threatening her intentions

Then a series of escalating events and interactions that intensify hero’s feelings thru emotional complications, driving her toward change
#### examples of emotional complication
- confrontations
- reunions
- borrowed time (characters have a finite window together, must make it count)
- crushed expectations
- threat of bodily harm or death

The dramatic events must have consequences that drive the plot forward
At the end of a dramatic scene, hero is in a daze, processing what just happened
_each moment, no matter how tiny, contains infinite sources of seduction and meaning_ —Leora Skulkin-Smith, on the work of Alice Munroe
