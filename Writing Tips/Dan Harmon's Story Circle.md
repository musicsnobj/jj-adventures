### 8 steps to better stories
![[harmon-story-circle.png]]

## YOU
Protagonist
Establish status quo of this world

Bruce Wayne
He fights crime

## NEED
Establish what’s wrong
External need: Bruce wants to hang it up, stop being Batman
Internal need: Bruce wants to be w/ Rachel

external + internal = actionable need: find a replacement batman
He sees hotshot DA Harvey Dent as a potential candidate

## GO
Hero takes the first step toward filling the need 
(enters the chaos realm of the circle)
Harvey Dent wants to capture Lao, a key individual in gotham’s organized crime scene.

If Bruce can help deliver Lao to Dent, he’d be free to take up the mantle (…? this confuses me. i thought pursuing criminals like Lao was the very buck he hoped to pass on to Dent. Is Dent all like _sure i’d love to take up this charge of catching criminals as soon i catch this one criminal?_)

## SEARCH
The action from step 2 didn’t satisfy the need. Only put more obstacles in the way.

As they celebrate the takedown of Lao, a brand new sort of criminal—Joker—crashes the party.
Pushing Bruce Wayne’s drive into a higher gear as Joker unleashes a new crime wave on Gotham

## FIND
Hero finds what they were looking for in step 2 but it doesn’t quite go as they'd expected

Joker threatens to kill people every day Batman doesn't reveal his identity.

It could be just the opportunity to hang up the cape, but before he can do it, Harvey Dent announces _he_ is Batman (removing himself as a possible candidate, obligating real Batman to continue his work)

## TAKE
Hero, having been given a taste of what they want, increases the range of what they'll do to get it. 
Takes it at considerable price.


Batman captures the joker, Who then reveals that Harvey and Rachel have both been taken and he can only save one of them.
He goes to rescue Rachel, but having been given false information on their whereabouts, rescues Harvey.

The loss of Rachel forces Bruce to consider his future, and his initial need


## RETURN

Emerge from the chaos realm having suffered a heavy loss
Hero is altered by their experiences from the 2nd act, and equipped with a new need

Gotham needs Batman more than ever, as Joker has flipped Harvey’s moral coin. Harvey is now two-face, on a mission to avenge Rachel’s death


## CHANGE
aka the final showdown that puts the hero’s change to the test

Bruce kills Harvey (Two-Face) and essentially takes blame for his murderous rampage, to preserve the clean image of Harvey Dent, for the good of Gotham
