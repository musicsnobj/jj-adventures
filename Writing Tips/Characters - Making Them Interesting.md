Every character is evaluated by three qualities:

*likability* - how much will the audience like them

*competency* - how good are they at what they do?

*activity* - how much do they persevere? do the effect the plot or does the plot effect them


|                 | likability | competency | activity |
| --------------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Bilbo Baggins   | HIGH       | LOW        | LOW      |
| Batman          | LOW        | HIGH       | HIGH     |
| Sherlock Holmes | LOW        | HIGH       | HIGH     |
| Superman        | HIGH       | HIGH       | HIGH     |

Character must rate high in at least one of the three to be interesting.
They cannot be good at all three (unless they have an intentionally flat arc).
