[TED Talk](Pixar's Andrew Stanton) by Pixar's Andrew Stanton

## Storytelling is joke telling

Knowing the pucnhline. Knowing that everything you’re saying from the first sentence to the last is leading to a singular goal.

And ideally confirming some truth that deepens our understanding of who we are as human beings

Connecting thru stories is one of the most life-affirming experiences.

Experience the similarities b/w ourselves and others, real and imagined.

"Frankly there isn’t anyone you couldn’t learn to love once you’ve heard their story" —Mr. Rogers

Make me care. Emotionally, aesthetically, intellectually, etc

Make a promise that where we’re going will be worth my time.

He references an early scene from [john carter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carter_(film)), a recent example i can think of is Frozen 2, _into the unknooooown_)


## 2 + 2
The audience wants to work for their meal but they don’t wanna know they’re doing that.

It’s your job as a storyteller to hide the fact that you’re making them work for it.

An interesting analogy he made is puppies and babies. Apparently their cuteness is not the only thing that attracts us to them; they can’t verbally express their intentions or what they’re thinking, and for us it’s like a dangling mystery, an answer we must have, a natural instinct to _finish the sentence_.

We like problem-solving

It’s a well-organized _absence of information_ that draws us in

Unifying theory of 2+2: make the audience put things together, i.e. *don’t give them 4, give them 2 + 2*

The elements you provide and the order you place them in are crucial to success or failure at engaging the audience

Storytelling is not an exact science

That’s what’s so special about stories

  
He also makes the point that humans are all born w/ a certain temperment. Some positive some negative. We have no control over it. But there’s a good lesson in owning it, recognizing your genetically predetermined shortcomings and taking charge.
Interesing.

we’re all learning who we are, all the time. life is not static


## Drama

"Drama is anticipation mangled with uncertainty" —William Archer, British playwright

### short term
*have you made me want to know what will happen next? *

### long term
*have you made me care about how it will conclude in the long run?*

*have you constructed honest conflicts with truth that creates doubt in what the outcome might be?*


He references *Finding Nemo*, where the local tension was will Dory forget what Marlin is telling her and it’s always shrouded in the larger uncertainty of will they ever find Nemo.

## Next-level Storytelling

Pixar’s writers' private set of rules:

- no songs
- no “i want” moment
- no happy village
- no love story
- no villain


## Wonder

That’s the magic ingredient
(he mentions seeing Bambi at age five, he left the theater wide-eyed with wonder)

can you invoke wonder

Wonder is honest, it’s completely innocent, can’t be artificially evoked

There’s no better gift from one human being to another. To hold them still for a brief moment in their day and have them surrender to wonder

It reaches you at a cellular level. The affirmation of being alive


And he did it. His conclusion got me. A full tear...

He once asked his father about the scars on his feet. He’d been born premature. Doctors said he wasn’t gonna live. He was sick in the hospital for several months. But enough blood transfusions later he was well enough to come home.

Marlin (Finding Nemo): _I’ve got you, I’ll never let anything happen to you…Nemo_
