## Monster in the House
^monsterinthehouse
[source](https://savethecat.com/monster-in-the-house)
A culpable hero is forced to save a trapped group of people from being killed by a monster she inadvertently unleashed.

*The 3 elements of a Monster In The House are:* 
1) A **monster** that is supernatural in its powers — even if its strength derives from insanity — and “evil” at its core.  
2) A **house,** meaning an enclosed space that can include a family unit, an entire town, or even “the world.”  
3) A **sin.** Someone is guilty of bringing the monster in the house… a transgression that can include ignorance.

## Golden Fleece
^goldenfleece
[source](https://savethecat.com/golden-fleece)
A driven hero must lead a group of allies to retrieve a prized possession through a perilous journey that wasn’t what she expected.

*The 3 elements of a Golden Fleece are:*
1) A **road** spanning oceans, time — or across the street — so long as it demarcates growth. It often includes a “Road Apple” that stops the trip cold.  
2) A **team** or a buddy the hero needs to be guided along the way. Usually, it’s those who represent the things the hero doesn’t have: skill, experience, or attitude. 
3) A **prize** that’s sought and is something primal: going home, securing a treasure, or re-gaining a birthright.

2) A **sudden event** that thrusts our innocent(s) into the world of hurt — and it comes without warning.

1) A **life problem**: from puberty to midlife to death — these are the universal passages we all understand.  
2) A **wrong way** to attack the mysterious problem, usually a diversion from confronting the pain.  
3) A solution that involves **acceptance** of a hard truth the hero has been fighting, and the knowledge it’s the hero that must change, not the world around him.

1) An **incomplete hero** who is missing something physical, ethical, or spiritual; (s)he needs another to be whole.  
2) A **counterpart** who makes that completion come about or has qualities the hero needs.  
3) A **complication**, be it a misunderstanding, personal or ethical viewpoint, epic historical event, or the prudish disapproval of society.

## Whydunit
^whydunit
*Detective, Secret, Dark Turn*
[source](https://savethecat.com/whydunit)
A single-minded hero must find the truth to a mystery so intriguing before she is swallowed by the darkness she desperately seeks to expose.

*The 3 elements of a Whydunit are:*
1) The **detective** does not change, we do; yet he can be any kind of gumshoe — from pro to amateur to imaginary.  
2) The **secret** of the case is so strong it overwhelms the worldly lures of money, sex, power, or fame. We _gots_ to know! And so does the Whydunit hero.  
3) Finally, the **dark turn** shows that in pursuit of the secret, the detective will break the rules, even his own — often ones he has relied on for years to keep him safe. The pull of the secret is too great.

## Fool Triumphant
^fooltriumphant
*Fool, Establishment, Transmutation*
[source](https://savethecat.com/fool-triumphant)
An innocent hero’s only way to defeat the prejudices of a group is to change herself without losing what made her the group’s target of disdain in the first place – her uniqueness.

*The 3 elements of a Fool Triumphant are:*
1) A **fool** whose innocence is his strength and whose gentle manner makes him likely to be ignored — by all but a jealous “Insider” who knows too well.  
2) An **establishment,** the people or group a fool comes up against, either within his midst, or after being sent to a new place in which he does not fit — at first.  
3) A **transmutation** in which the fool becomes someone or something new, often including a “name change” that’s taken on either by accident or as a disguise.

## Institutionalized
^institutionalized
*Group, Choice, Sacrifice*
[source](https://savethecat.com/institutionalized)
An outsider’s only way to save her individuality is by going against the many who wish to integrate her into their fold.

*The 3 elements of Institutionalized are:*
1) Every story in this category is about a **group** — a family, an organization, or a business that is unique.  
2) The story is a **choice,** the ongoing conflict pitting a “Brando” or “Naif” vs. the system’s “Company Man.”  
3) Finally, a **sacrifice** must be made and you get three endings: join, burn it down… or commit “suicide.”

## Superhero
^superhero
*Special Power, Nemesis, Curse*
[source](https://savethecat.com/superhero)
A uniquely special hero must defeat an opponent with stronger capabilities by using the same powers that disconnect her from the people she hopes to save.

*The 3 elements of a Superhero are:*
1) The hero of your tale must have a special **power** — even if it’s just a mission to be great or do good.  
2) The hero must be opposed by a **nemesis** of equal or greater force, who is the “self-made” version of the hero.  
3) There must be a **curse** for the hero that he either surmounts or succumbs to as the price for who he is.
