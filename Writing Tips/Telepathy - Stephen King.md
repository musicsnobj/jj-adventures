every scene in a story must have minimum one purpose

the more ways in which an element of your story serves purpose the more efficient and compelling that story becomes

Notes on Stephen King’s _On Writing_:

when you write a story, you’re telling _yourself_ the story

when you rewrite, your main job is to take out everything that is _not_ the story

write with the door closed, rewrite w/ the door open

more people want to do the former than the latter

  

a rare glimpse into a female locker room (for maintenance of some kind)

an article in life magazine suggesting some evidence of telekinesis in people, especially young girls

childhood cruelty + telekinesis = carrie

  

writing is telepathy

  

use active, not passive verbs. active = the subject is executing the action, passive = the action is happening to the subject

passive = the meeting will be held at 7

active = the meeting’s at 7

  

adverbs are not your friend. 

he closed the door _firmly_

the enlightening/emotionally moving prose leading up to his closing the door should convey enough information that we can picture how he did it

the road to hell is paved with adverbs. they’re like dandelions. if you have one on your lawn it looks pretty and unique. fail to root it out and you find five the next day, fifty the next…

  

tell the truth

  

you don’t create plots, you discover them

you create the world for it to grow

and you transcribe it as it does

_situation_ rather than story

  

plot points shouldn’t be rigid and fixed

don’t force your characters to do things your way. let them figure things out _their_ way

as not only the writer, but the story’s first _reader_, it’s best that the ending remain malleable

if you can’t figure out where it’s going despite your advanced knowledge of coming events, you can expect the reader will be kept adequately uncertain too

  

don’t over-describe characters’ appearances

locale and texture are more important to immersing the reader

choose a few well-chosen details that will stand for everything else
