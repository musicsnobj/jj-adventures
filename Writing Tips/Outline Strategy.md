*Ex Machina* screenplay writer

write about a page of one-line story beats
```
Caleb meets Nathan, the CEO mastermind, at his secluded home in Alaska.

Nathan takes Caleb to his room and explains the key card system: the card will let him know which rooms are off limits and which are okay for him to enter.

Nathan has Caleb sign an NDA and reveals that they're going to be performing a Turing Test with an AI he has created.

Caleb meets Ava, a prototype AI, made in the form of a beautiful girl.

Caleb and Ava have their first conversation.

Caleb and Nathan discuss Caleb's first meeting with Ava.

Caleb brushes his teeth to go to bed. We he has long healed scars on his back.

Caleb, unable to sleep, turns on the TV only to reveal CCTV security footage of Ava at all times.

Caleb finds an empty room with a phone inside it. He tries to activate it with his key card but is startled by Nathan who tells him that he does not have access, in case he would call the outside world and tell someone about Ava.
```

Then cursor back to the top of the page and start writing the first scene
Deleting the one-line story beats as he traverses them
So the story grows as the beat list shrinks
Once he’s done the last beat, that’s a first draft
And it will be crap (his words), but it will be something to work with
And getting there (finishing the first draft) is the hardest part
