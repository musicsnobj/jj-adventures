Based on the Ashley Bates experience...
Hero meets hot girl at Starbucks, smitten, big crush, she runs her own business online. They exchange numbers in case she ever needs tech support.

Hero texts her once to ask her out. No response.

Months later, out of the blue, she calls him. Not a text. An incoming call from $ashleyBates-type

she’s got a client breathing down her neck, thinking she broke his web site

emergency tech support

of course hero helps her

she thanks him and gives the explanation for her silence. an ex had apologized and she took him back, or whatev…

but she’s single now

and wants to thank hero in person

hero got information $bigTechCo wants

$bigTechCo made those medical implants for neurosurgery, they read everyone’s thoughts. they implant dreams and monitor blood flow

they figured out he never stopped thinking about $ashleyBates after that one encounter

they read $ashleyBates’ thoughts and blackmail her into helping them get the info from hero
