Basically your journey.  

Only child, mom died early.  Intelligent dad raised him; super christian.  

Grows up, learns more things, changes mind.  Discussions with Dad.  Interactions with christian/gay/black/corporate/poor/wealthy communities.

Somewhere in there is that email you wrote to your dad.
