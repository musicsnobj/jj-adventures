Story of one persons's journey through the political ladder.

Maybe starts out by tweeting something that goes viral in his community.  Becomes state rep or alderman.  Mayor?  

Does something sensational within his city/state that grabs national attention.  Now he has a national voice that more people listen to.  Runs for presdient?  Or perhaps is so popular that someone running for president wants him to be their VP.  

Somewhere in there is a misstep followed immediately by a statement of taking full responsisibility and making ammends.
