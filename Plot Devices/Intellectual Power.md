+Programmers work for companies, but their tech skills tend to be generally higher than that of their superiors, so they can pull off shady things like programming a virus to delete all the code if i ever get fired, etc.

A terrorist. A genius programmer. Sees himself as an artist. He’s unleashed a malevolent force—maybe a bio virus, but could just be a T-1000 indestructable humanoid thing—a puzzle that no one can solve. No programmer can reverse engineer.

An insecure programmer who was always expendable cuz they just needed his code, he finally gets the upper hand.

Laid off, disgraced, cheated out of his intellectual artwork.

He programs a path of destruction that no one can stop.

They need him. They have to do what he says. Only he can undo what he set in motion
