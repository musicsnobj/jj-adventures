The hero villain aspect, as well as the bromances from Tombstone re-imagines for today's political climate.

i'm thinking this might fit well w/ the t**** nuked a hurricane story

the story isn't about t**** per se, but his actions as president have serious consequences for the characters
the story takes place in a small town near the florida coast, recently ravaged by hurricane gamma
  (ooh that actually works well, address naming storms w/ greek alphabet while subtly hinting that the storm contains gamma radiation)
the wyatt earp equivalent just retired and moved into town to be near his grandkids as they grow
retired...military? law enforcement? nuclear engineering?
somehow his knowledge allows him to recognize what's happening
  he's a die hard t**** supporter
    drives the whole family to west palm beach for every rally

maybe earp was a community college professor, nuclear engineering

hurricane harvey
hit texas
  texas might be a better setting for a tombstone story than florida
