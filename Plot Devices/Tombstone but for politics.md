The hero villain aspect, as well as the bromances from Tombstone re-imagines for today's political climate.

i'm thinking this might fit well w/ the t**** nuked a hurricane story

the story isn't about t**** per se, but his actions as president have serious consequences for the characters
the story takes place in a small town near the florida coast, recently ravaged by hurricane gamma
  (ooh that actually works well, address naming storms w/ greek alphabet while subtly hinting that the storm contains gamma radiation)
the wyatt earp equivalent just retired and moved into town to be near his grandkids as they grow
retired...military? law enforcement? nuclear engineering?
somehow his knowledge allows him to recognize what's happening
  he's a die hard t**** supporter
    drives the whole family to west palm beach for every rally

maybe earp was a community college professor, nuclear engineering

hurricane harvey
hit texas
  texas might be a better setting for a tombstone story than florida
  
i keep coming back to earp being retired law enforcement, but that just seems too close to the real thing, and kind of an overused trope

his background has to satisfy these conditions:
1. He has advanced knowledge of nuclear fission, such that when he sees the unimpeachable evidence of what's happening, his intellect is put in direct conflict with his intuition
2. He's a stalwart, not merely a resident, of MAGA country. When he first sounds the alarm, folks think he's gone out of his mind. But he's such a fixture in the community they have to give him an ear
3. He has a few similarly skilled, also retired colleagues he can call in to help him save the town. They come at a moment's notice even knowing they're walking into a radiation hotbed. This is where the bromances could come in



Instead of a submarine launching the nuke, I think a single stealth bomber would be way easier to conceal for longer.  Less people know about one random plane, plus remote detonation is accessible
