I want to keep thinking and writing about Ashley Bates despite the reality that she (the *real* Ashley) won't be an important figure in my life.
That encounter compelled me to do something I hadn't even thought to do in years, ask out a girl. Someone I'd met in real life no less!

She belongs in a story as some hero's unnattainable goddess.![[Screen Shot 2021-03-26 at 2.27.24 PM.png]]
