_uncle amos…what are stars made of?_

oooh i don’t know boy…

i like to think they’re all made of the same bits and pieces we see down here in the world…

like there’s some kinda cosmic forces holding everything together

_cosmic forces? like God?_

oooh i don’t know boy…

but deep down in my soul i feel that everything we’ve ever seen came out of one singular event a long long time ago…

like first none of this was here and then _bang!_ (too much?) all the building blocks of the universe blasted into existence, then some universal laws took the whole thing over and said if there’s too much stuff in one spot, it all clings togethguger in a big ball…


…and so forth

could be a good character in [[Emporer's Alt Clothes]] if set in 1400s
