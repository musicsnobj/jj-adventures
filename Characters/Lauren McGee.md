### info
American, Female, 31

### occupation
"Journalist"

### appearance
5'8", long blonde hair, skinny, attractive

### background
Born into a rich, well-connected family in Manhattan, the oldest of four.
Studied journalism at Harvard where she carried the debate team through several national championships

### traits
Diagnosed psychopath since age 14, when her parents put her under examination after poisoning an ex's dog. Her mother refused to accept the diagnosis, believing they could pray their daughter normal.
Lauren's own realization that she was *not* normal compelled her to study other humans closely, mirror their behaviors, design her own "human suit" that would be the answer to her mother's prayers.
It worked. "Finding Jesus" was the best decision she ever made. Now she could get whatever she wanted. From parents, teachers, employers, eventually a prime time audience.

Her brother is the one person who knows and accepts who she truly is.
