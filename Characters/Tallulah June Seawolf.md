...who’s just a really smart chick who invented a legit memory reader (like in black mirror “crocodile”) that gives her the information and she jus pretends it’s coming from a “restless spirit”

The story could begin with a detective trying to solve a case and the seargent tells him about Lady Telulah or whoever 

...yeah Tallulah actually. This could be my Tallulah June character 

It makes perfect sense cuz her mom is Jess Self and she would obviously teach her all about the dangers of religion and superstition in general

Incidentally she also learns how easy it is to manipulate ppl who are superstitious 

Maybe she’s the one who’s grad school professor tries to take credit for her work and she disappears with all her research (planting some kind of virus to delete it all from the university records)

Professor can’t reproduce it, he’s exposed as a fraud. But he’s already got the patent so she can’t apply for it. She _can_ however—being the the one who _actually_ knows how it works—use the technology herself disguising it as a cosmic gift, telling grieving family members exactly what they want to hear and just _raking in the 

Til the detective shows up wanting her help with a case


nothing else to add at this point

just realized she is a very distinctive character and would probably really enthrall audiences in the right circumstances

pretty, petite southern gal yet extremely intellectual

might face challenges that force her to take off the southern charm and really kick some ass

  

i don’t know anything about the universe she’ll live in, maybe there’s a place for her in the syria story

could she be the pastor’s kid who arranges for nejane and rudi to come to US?

or would she fit better in [[Emporer's Alt Clothes]]?

nah she belongs in an american setting, her southernness is important. america sometime post-civil war works best
