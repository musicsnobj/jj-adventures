i just did a bunch of bong hits and got the urge to write! is that wonderful?

  

i want to write a scene. i was thinking of my convo with jess in which she asked what i do when someone gets in my face about something.

i’ve had that idea for a character who knows all the answers, who people who are in a bind or just want to get ahead in their careers or lives call for advice.

i don’t know about his past, or even really his personality

i’m not sure if he’s a hero, a villain, neither or both just yet

i picture his role with the reader as something like rick from rick n morty

always super prepared for every possible outcome. strategizing, recalculating constantly

we should come up with a backstory of how he came to be that way, but not for this first short scene

  

here we’re only telling the story of one scene

someone sees an ad or gets a tip that they should get in touch with him

or it’s a joke. some friends at a party decide to submit a query to {{knowitall.com}} website or something

and the answer ends up working out really well

what’s the question…

writing seems like a gargantuan task when i’m right up against it, but when i’m not actually here putting pen to paper —figuratively obvi— i feel like ideas just flow like honey

what’s one of those ideas…

for a scene

a scene is a story. so what’s the want

the obstacle?

the action?
