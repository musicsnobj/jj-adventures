America has 5% of the world’s population, but 25% of the world's _incarcerated_ population.

In 1977 we had ~300,000 people in prison, since then it’s jumped to 2.3 million.

After the civil war, the 13th amendment allowed us to imprison former slaves for “vagrancy”.

We needed bodies to rebuild after the war, and there was the first American prison boom

Films like *Birth of a Nation* perpetuated the myth of black men as rapists, savages.

The Nixon White House admitted outright that the war on drugs was about imprisoning hippies and blacks:

_“The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and the blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”_

—John Ehrlichman, Nixon advisor
