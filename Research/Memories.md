semantic memory - facts, names, dates

episodic memory - visual stories

  

when you have an experience, sensory info is processed in many parts of your brain

e.g. from your cello recital you recall:

    the sound of the cello - auditory cortex

    feeling of the strings on your fingers - post-frontal lobe

    the face of your friend in the audience - fusiform gyrus

    the pang of stage fright - amygdala

the medial temporal lobe is what ties all these elements together

    which includes the _hippocampus_

when you recall the recital later, the medial temporal lobe helps combine those elements once again

(your life story is comprised of all these moments you can relive)

  

given a visual stimla that’s emotional in nature (e.g. the face of a loved one), the amygdala—the emotional center, positioned right next to the hippocampus—helps up-regulate the hippocampus, allowing it to form a more detailed and stronger memory

  

memories are strongly associated to time & place

memories are also strengthened by _story_

our brains pay much closer to information when it’s in the form of a story

  

we’re emotional and visual learners

…and _storytellers_
