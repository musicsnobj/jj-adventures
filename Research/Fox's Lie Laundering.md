From Brian Stelter's book *Hoax*
While every other morning show on tv was scrutinizing the Trump Tower meeting, Fox & Friends jumped on a story from _The Hill_ newspaper, about Comey, one of the show’s chosen longtime villains. The banner on screen on Fox & Friends said “Report: Comey leaked classified material”, even tho _The Hill_ didn’t actually report that. Fox & Friends' Twitter feed shared this erroneous news and then Trump did too (without bothering to credit Fox in this case).

Trump tweeted “James Comey leaked classified information to the media. that is SO illegal!”

Trump was wrong. And it was Fox’s fault. The network was guilty of actively misinforming the President. Fox & Friends should’ve run a correction immediately. 

But instead, the network started covering Trump’s leak allegation like it was legitimate news, and not just a regurgitation of their morning show’s screw-up. This was _lie laundering_. It took a full 24hrs for the “friends" to sheepishly admit 'we were mistaken'. There was never any acknowledgement that the network had deluded Trump, and he never walked back his Comey smear, even after the DOJ’s Inspector General confirmed in 2019 that Comey never leaked anything classified.

When that IG confirmation came out, Comey sent a tweet to “all those who spent two years talking about me going to jail, or about being a liar and a leaker, ask yourselves why you still trust people who gave you bad info for so long, including the President”

Yes, Comey was right to call out the president, and he also could’ve called out Fox’s biggest stars.
