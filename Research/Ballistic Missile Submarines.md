In 2011, _Wyoming_ became one of the first four submarines to allow female officers. During patrols from August to November 2013 and March to June 2014, four women were secretly recorded in the shower changing room, including midshipmen and officers assigned to the boat. An investigation resulted in eight male sailors being [court-martialed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court-martial "Court-martial") and three receiving [captain's mast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain%27s_mast).

On 6 June 2012, _Wyoming_ participated in a historic medevac exercise with a [Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Boeing_V-22_Osprey "Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey") making a 12,000 nautical mile flight to collect a stretcher from the submarine.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Wyoming_(SSBN-742)#cite_note-5)


A submerged resupply is technically possible. We have small rescue submarines called DSRV’s that could act as a ferry between two submerged submarines. That's literally what they are designed for.

Howeve, as a modern nuclear submarine is self sufficient in all but food it's impractical.

A modern submarine can carry approximately 90–120 days of food. If the covert mission exceeds that well, someone seriously screwed up.
