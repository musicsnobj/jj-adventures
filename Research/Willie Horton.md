Dukakis had a double-digit lead over G.H.W. Bush the Willie Horton ads started.
Dukakis had supported a weekend furlough program for prisoners.
Willie Horton had been furloughed, and abducted and killed a white couple.

The Bush campaign took the angle that Dukakis isn’t tough enough on violent crime.

But the ad was more about stirring up racial tension.
And of course he won

(the first one anyway)

_"No matter what anybody says or what anybody does, they know exactly what button they were trying to hit with that ad”_

—Van Jones

Horton was metaphorically the black male rapist that had been a staple of the white imagination since the time just after slavery (_Birth of a Nation_)

As it happens, the record of interracial rape in America is far more marked by white rape against black women than of black men against white women.
