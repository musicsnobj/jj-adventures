## the lie
The version of events that best reinforces my preferred narrative must be the truth

## the lesson
The right answer isn't always the one that feels good. Sometimes you have to turn off your intuitive judgments in order to truly follow the evidence.

## examples
A small cable network, [[OAN]] can run a bogus story, a well-designed piece of propaganda goes straight to the heart. fills you with a sense of duty to get the word out to as many ppl as possible.

- It starts on social media, where it spreads like wildfire w/ no mechanism to extinguish it
- It reaches a critical mass, and the story is large enough to get picked up by Fox News
	- Thatâ€™s kinda like the virus going airborne
- Trump is a catalyst
	- His novel use of the bully pulpit created a highly infectious environment
	- Stories of any size or veracity
		- If they appeal to trump, they get that blessed retweet
		- And they have momentum
			- An endless runway to continue replicating, trying out new mutations
- Effective propaganda targets a particular group profile
	- that profile is typically based on an aggregate of group members
		- an unscrupulous news network might try to target it at one single person who, if successfully infected, would be guaranteed to put their little outfit on the map
