The legend of old St Nicholas is useful to kids. in their minds he’s their one and only connection to toys other than their s___head parents. but that changes as they grow up and make money. having their own capacity to buy toys eliminates the need for Santa, so they grow up and abandon that silly kid nonsense.

But a lot of us go on believing in God. In our minds he holds the fate of our immortal souls. That’s like the promise of all the toys in the afterlife. People fear death. Even more, we fear ceasing to exist. We don’t want to picture a universe that carries right on without us.

But at some point you just have to grow up and stop believing in Santa Claus.

I think the pressures that compelled us to invent both God and Santa live on the same continuum. Two versions of the same thing.

Every kid wants toys, but not every kid is rich. Still, even poor families need their kids to behave. They need a carrot to dangle, especially one not limited by the families' financial resources. In a way, Santa is kind of like the great equalizer in the minds of poor kids. *Surely he'll see my good behavior and reward me with a bounty of toys.* 
They'd finally have their justice over the rich kids they envied.

God is adults' answer to the same injustice.

It's our story about an omnipotent being who will reward our righteousness on a scale that far exceeds anything we could've earned on our own.

And with the promise of eternal life—even just a clear mission in life—on the table, a person will suspend many faculties for critical thinking to preserve that fantasy.
Not unlike a kid learning the implausibility of Santa Claus for the first time, but wanting so badly to cling to that belief.
