Like a the "bait-and-switch" sales tactic,  but ongoing
They bait us by appealing to some age old concept we hold sacred, e.g. the 2nd Amendment right to bear arms.
Over the next four hundred years they gradually revise the definition of *arm*. And some of us are still so fixated on the sanctity of the 2nd Amendment, we can go on defending the legality of assault weapons with pride, even a sense of righteousness.

The same kind of bait and revise tactic could be applied to the Bible, or Christianity in general, i.e. a bad actor can bait a religious person and essentially weaponize their beliefs for his own sinister purposes.

Find an interesting way to illustrate a similar pattern. Take some historical liberties such that instead of arms, the peoples' right to ingest poppyseed extract was written into the Constitution.
Over time, technology allows for the poppies' essence to be harvested more effectively, consumed in increasingly more potent forms, eventually a needle directly to the vein.
The country spirals into a nightmare of addiction and overdose deaths. Heroin lobbyists keep the political donations flowing, the politicians go on camera and point the finger at an epidemic of depression fueling all the heroin deaths, etc.
