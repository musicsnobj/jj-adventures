A good chess player is basically a good storyteller

Above a certain level you’re not just calculating positions anymore. The top players are only trying to get their opponents to believe the story they present.

Doesn’t hurt the story aspect that the game pieces are named after military entities.

At a tournament I want to tell my opponents the saddest story they've ever heard, and have them believe every word of it.
