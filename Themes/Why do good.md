## the lie
God exists, and everything happens according to His plan

## the lesson
God is just one of many stories we tell each other to make sense of random, meaningless s___ that happens


## examples

The whole flight i prayed with all my might we wouldn't miss our connection. We were seated in row two, but Camden's stroller was back in row five in the overhead. I saw the scene play out in my head:
standing there impatient, waiting for the last of our 260 fellow passengers to shuffle off so we can reach just a few rows back for the stroller, and by that point our connection is long gone and we're back in full-on stress mode.
But in those crucial seconds before they opened the doors, a stranger in row five turned and looked right at me. I knew in that moment that God had heard me. The stranger looked at me expectantly, like he knew I had something to ask him.
"Would you mind getting our stroller?"
And he did. And we made our connection.
Don't tell me God doesn't hear our prayers.


I felt a moment of panic as soon as i landed in LaGuardia. I'd managed to get the device through security, and it sat in my bag in the overhead compartment the whole flight without detonating, though my heart raced for a good bit when the flight attendant shuffled it around to make room for a stroller.
Once we were landed, i opened the overhead and pulled out my bag. To my horror, it wasn't fully zipped and the metal faceplate was shining plain as day for a brief second before i buried it in my coat. Stupidly, I looked around to see if anyone noticed. A young woman a few rows up was just staring at me. I searched my brain for some innocent explanation for what she'd just seen, but there was nothing.
Then she spoke.
"Would you mind getting our stroller?"
Phew, thank god.
