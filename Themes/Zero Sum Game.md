## the lie
Victory is accomplished not by compromising or cooperating with your enemies, but by defeating them

## the lesson
Most conflicts are not a zero sum game. There is almost always a better, mutually beneficial solution to be found

## examples
Two divorcees share custody of their only child, and compete constantly for her affection. Both parents plan their precious time with their daughter minute by minute, every action designed to glorify themselves and undermine the other in her eyes.
Their tactics become increasingly volatile.
They've hurt each other so much, it's become almost impossible to see each other as anything but an enemy, a threat to be eliminated.

Two political parties compete for the soul of the country.
