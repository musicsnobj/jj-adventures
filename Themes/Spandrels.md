## Spandrels

Named for the near-triangular areas on either side of an arch. Spandrels were put into the design of buildings and cathedrals, not for aesthetics, but as an engineering choice, to improve structural integrity. Then Rennaissance artists started adding artistic elements to the spandrels, i.e. making good creative use of that space

The concept also lends itself to biology. Stephen Jay Gould repurposed the term to describe physical traits that are more byproducts of the evolution of other traits than they are a direct product of natural selection.

Climate change denial is kind of an evolutionary spandrel, but for the evolution of the conservative worldview
It was useful for conservatives to believe global warming was a hoax, so they'd continue voting for politicians who supported big oil

Today, renewable energies are more economically viable. they're the future. china's already way ahead. it's just a matter of the us staying competitive. no one's making the argument that what our economy needs is for big oil to come back

Yet, the belief that climate change is a hoax, a lie of use to no one anymore, persists in our worldview unless there's some specific selection pressure against it
