[[Evolutionary Spandrels]]

## the lie
Tradition should be preserved for its own sake

## the lesson
Traditions can become outdated. "We've always done it this way" is never the right answer


## examples

Climate change denial is kind of an evolutionary spandrel, but for the evolution of the conservative worldview
It was useful for conservatives to believe global warming was a hoax, so they'd continue voting for politicians who supported big oil

Today, renewable energies are more economically viable. they're the future. china's already way ahead. it's just a matter of the us staying competitive. no one's making the argument that what our economy needs is for big oil to come back

Yet, the belief that climate change is a hoax, a lie of use to no one anymore, persists in our worldview unless there's some specific selection pressure against it
