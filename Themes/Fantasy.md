One memory i have from childhood is wearing a tiger mask into the grocery store. I was maybe five. My mom was happy to indulge me, join me in pretending i was a tiger. Until i took the game too far, picked up a random object (a box of jell-o i think) and clinched it in my mouth, leaving clear bite marks. Mom got angry and of course the game is over. I learned not to get carried away with my fantasies

I feel like i'm facing the same dilemma w/ my father, except he's the kid running around pretending to be a tiger and I'm the adult trying to rein him in. He's been allowed to pretend for so long tho, he believes he truly is a tiger. A dangerous jungle beast who will sink his teeth into every jell-o box in the store if he damn well pleases. I can't take him anywhere.

His right-wing fantasies have always been dangerous on some level. But back in the day, the consequences of those fantasies were so far in the future. Now his fantasies have him spreading harmful information to vulnerable ppl.

The tiger story might not be the best analogy for this.
Plenty of angles to take w/ the theme of our own personal fantasies. Especially in America
