 

the dread. pirate. roberts.  
it could be so awesome if it were done right.  
same universe as the princess bride, but much earlier.  
we meet the original dread pirate roberts. and see others succeed him like in dr who. like one dread pirate roberts is in power for the duration of a season.  
and eventually the mysterious ryan takes power and he'll be the one we make the audience fall in love with initially. he's super badass, strategical genius and runs a tight ship but inside he can't forgive himself for blah blah blah. but he's also the most diplomatic and never executes a prisoner unless he absolutely has to even though the DPR famously never leaves survivors. storylines could come from his crew thinking he's weak and trying to mutiny. eventually he captures a merchant ship carrying a young farmboy by the name of westley (who looks enough like a young cary elwes to get our generation's panties wet)!!and we get to see the whole saga of ryan not knowing what to do with the boy, and then slowly becoming friends, ryan mentoring westley in swordfighting, hand-to-hand combat and strategy (all of which will clearly come in handy one day). maybe we learn how and why he developed an immunity to the iocane plant. then one day ryan pulls him aside and tells him the secret behind the DPR, and he understands that the title is being offered to him. westley sees this as his shot at getting back to the woman he loves.

 

then the whole next season westley's in charge with his own crew, but obviously the crew believes he is the one and only roberts so the name westley is never mentioned the whole season. maybe we follow him to various ports and in each episode he faces an enemy who he has to defeat with either his brains, his strength or his steel. obviously he'll have to be in a situation where he's badly tortured at some point (cuz of the smug statement he'll lay on the albino later on, "i can cope with torture"). we also watch the ladies fall all over him but he only has eyes for buttercup (and maybe we're following her rags to unwanted riches story as well).

then at the end of the season he lands back in good old florin and gets the girl, and it's a big tv drama moment even though we all know what's gonna happen. then who's DPR next season? that's right: INDIGO MONTOYA!! who should totally be played by lord oberin from game of thrones!

Siren bargain
Missions for the King/Queen of Blank
At one point someone who was presumed dead from a previous DPR crew comes upon current DPR and knows it isn't him.

Could come up with some really fucking cool sea shanties
