like on retropie games you can save the exact state of the game such that when you die you can just reload from that position, same # of lives as when you saved

given that the universe is likely a complex simulation running on a machine somewhere, the concept of saving the state of the universe could make a good hard sci fi premise

think of how we run mario thru the same set of obstacles and watch him die over and over before finally beating the level. to mario it only feels like he went thru it once—the time he got all the way to the end—because every time he died we reverted back to that exact _state_, before mario ever encountered those obstacles. he has no memory of dying over and over. only we, the player, remember

a character could be trying to set up some time travel experiment and accidentally gets a glimpse of the next "network layer” up, like the operating system running the application. maybe he stumbles on a way to revert to a previous state. and somehow access information useful for navigating it the next time

==Perhaps dejavu is a glitch that happens when you restart.==
