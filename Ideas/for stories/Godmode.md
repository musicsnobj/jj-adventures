  

you know that guy in the movie who warns everyone about what’s coming? everyone’s                                                                                                                        like “that guy’s crazy” and no one listens but then he turns out to be right?

i think i’m supposed to be that guy.

  

  

brain mapping nanobot technology is used to 

forensics

maybe greg locke is law enforcement, trying to drum up evidence on a weinstein-type. the mapper technology allows greg to see his episodic memories. not admissable as evidence, but gives enough info to set the perfect trap for him.

when you sleep…

that’s when the nanos do their work

track your neural firing patterns

monitor the blood flow to your…groin

  

ashley was victimized

  her brainchild was stolen from under her by her colleagues

    there’s no way a girl like you did all this research

  she complained, and was silenced. strong-armed. 

her teammate, a silver spoon prettyboy, took credit for her research

  

that teammate now works for the nano medical company

  

a popular nano product is a birth control device. most adult women use it

it’s so simple. you take a pill, install an app, then you can turn your fortress on or off with a single tap

the only birth control device with 100% success rate

ashley uses it

  

one day she notices a nano advertisement that siezes her attention

it seems modeled after a movie scene that aroused her as a kid. she can’t take her eyes off it

she puts it together…her backstabbing ivy league nemesis is using GOD Mode

[[Memories]]

time to make some plot decisions…

ashley is not here to help greg. she’s using him
