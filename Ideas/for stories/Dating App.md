the money always goes up

that's what those fat cats are used to

we just made it so their bank accounts kept going up

and they stayed fat dumb and happy

meanwhile the coal mines, the auto plants, they were all converted to solar panel manufacturing plants and there was a new job boom

  

  

ok

hear me out

sex predator is involved in some online platform that gamifies womanizing

he seduces women through dating apps, never revealing his true identity

  

the hero decides she's gonna be a vigilante

she'll use big data to train herself to seduce men, just like like the villain did.

at some point, she poses this plan to a close friend who laughs in her face and says something like: 'big data? with men all you gotta do is ask!'

she's always opposed laws that allow online platforms to sell your data

this is an opportunity for a new technology. something that is on the horizon

and how it could theoretically be used for this purpose.

  

you're good at helping me see what's right in front of my face. you always have. just...when i say i am 'absolutely certain' about something, know that i have already gone through most of the logical scenarios you would challenge me on. when i say those words, you can trust me to the extent that you believe our brains are truly identical.

  

big data.

self driving cars?

location info

location info

big data

  

her past might come back to haunt her

we could do a moment of vulnerability where it's revealed that she took cyber revenge in a most immature and public fashion in her younger days, while now she speaks out against misuse of private information

Free wi-fi for the entire town WHICH HAS TRANSFORMED INTO A CAMPUS FOR A MAJOR TECH COMPANY.

perhaps this is a universe in which legislation has been passed

  

  

The free wi-fi? Sure it gives us an aggregate of traffic streams over a given period of time. no specific ips come through the pathfinder system--

  

buttt you could pick up signals independently and connect masqed users to their timestamped locations, yes?

  

ahem, well for a clever enough hacker--

  

as it happens the guys with front row access to this information are ranked among the cleverest hackers in the world, by your own public statement. do you think it's possible that--

  

now hold up a sec there. say what you will about me or my company, but blockchain employees are the lifeblood of--

  

enough with the song and dance, mister crylen. i'm simply asking wh--

  

no, your suggesting—conveniently right here in front of all these cameras—that these girls are dead because one of my employees tracked their locations and sold them to this maniac. i won’t sit here and let you defame them like that

i’ll have you know every one of these brilliant young men and women has spent an entire week in the Blockchain ethics seminar. These folks know better than anyone what can happen when data gets into the wrong hands. that’s why they spent hours of their off time with police getting them the data that would lead to his capture. i assure you my guys are on the right side of this. they wouldn’t be here otherwise.

  

_the protagonist intervened once in this case, using their same location technology to prove that he had somehow destroyed evidence of his involvement in this information exchange. it was against her policy, but she couldn’t let $whiteMaleGeekBoss get away with it. she scraped his location, which would never be admissible in court on its own, but she was clever and left an anonymous tip with the detective investigating the murders to find some reason, any reason to check $whiteMaleGeekBoss’s GPS._

  

_now she’s faced with whether to commit the same breach of privacy for a less noble purpose_
