based on the oliver sacks “vision from the universe” of true indigo

a story about that phenomenon when we feel like a higher intelligence is trying to communicate with us. like our mind is in an open enough state (in dr sacks’ case, on a hallucinogen) that some spiritual presence from a higher dimension knows the time is right to make the siren call

like that time i got high on the couch at 640 w sheridan and i felt like the universe was inviting me to a higher echelon of thought and genuinely asked for my consent, which i gave, then a short while later i was obsessed with evolution and went on a science kick that’s still on motion to this day
