a protagonist who is suicidal

learns of a serial killer in the city with a specific _modus operandi_

(like the craigslist ad in Creep, where becoming the next victim is as easy as responding to the ad)

protagonist purposely enters the trap

  

that’s an interesting setup

good chance to use stephen king’s advice re: situation-driven rather than plot-driven

i.e. - start w/ the setup and let the characters behave how they would

as opposed to

setting a map of sequential events and forcing the characters to follow it





Perhaps killer sees something in protagonist that makes him stay his hand for a while but keeps him under lock and key for now.  Perhaps protagonist and killer develop a relationship.

Plot twist: Protagonist assumes killers identity after killing him?  Much more exicting life- no longer wants to die.  Perhaps starts tying with the idea of serial killing?
