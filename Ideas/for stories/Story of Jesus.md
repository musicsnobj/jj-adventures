Society was morally corrupt so a band of skilled performers decided to create a new religion that would focus on being a decnet human being.

Planning process- 

The Jesus that is a child in the stories is not the Jesus who is the man.  No middle story of Jesus because there literally isnt one.  Made up the baby manger story.

Could be room for a twist whereby the hero is a distant blood descendant of whoever stood in the shadows pulling the strings for the original Jesus

Skilled performers group come up with a pre written script and select who among them will be the "prophet".  Perhaps by drawing straws because they know ahead of time that that person will have to "die for humanities sins".  All miracles performed in new testament are illusions concocted by the performers.  Water into wine- fish multiply etc.  This convinces people to follow the teachings.

That same skill set in the hands of someone more diabolical?
Just conclude the show with the announcement "I am the second coming of Christ"
How many would believe him? The number is not zero.

Imagine that skill set in the hands of someone more diabolical.

Funded by the MAGI?
