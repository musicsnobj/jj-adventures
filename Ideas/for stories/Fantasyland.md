Revive that story idea where we control the top one percent by basically redistributing their wealth via an elaborate system in a Cayman-like offshore place but the facility that’s holding all this wealth is investing it in US science research which spawns  lucrative new industries making universal healthcare possible, allowing for everyone’s general welfare. The fatcats are none the wiser because the Cayman bank just tells them how much they have in their accounts, knowing full well they’ll never make a significant dent in it.
