## act 1

a courtier of the king of siam—a hamilton-type outsider who wrote/talked his way up to the kings court—is in an affair with the king's favorite wife, Chatmanee, and plots to escape with her. the king learns of this. he considers killing the man, but instead decides to gift $hamilton with a sacred white elephant, knowing it will consume his finances and and legally prevent him from leaving the country.

the king presents $hamilton with the animal at a grand banquet honoring his military acheivements. $hamilton knows that he knows. he grits his teeth, smiles and accepts.

the king offers $hamilton a permanent position as commander of his military (knowing he must accept or he can't possibly meet the maintainence costs of the elephant)

still $hamilton refuses the position, deciding he'd rather hop on the elephant and ride for nepal than serve in these humiliating circumstances. the law (my version) is you can't leave the country "without the elephant".

## act 2

he rides yong-yut north thru the jungle. he immediately knows he can't control the beast. they stop for food when yong-yut is hungry, they stop for the night when yong-yut is tired.

various characters seduce the elephant with pieces of fruit...

^i'm thinking the ones w/ the fruit are the fox news types, pleasing the elephant and planting bad information in the rider, which he then spreads to other villages

another angle could be the elephant goes on a killing spree, and $hamilton has to cover it up

i.e. this murderous elephant can continue uninterrupted because this smart human enables him
