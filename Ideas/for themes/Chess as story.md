a good chess player is basically a good storyteller

above a certain level you’re not just calculating positions anymore. the top players are only trying to get their opponents to believe the story they present

doesn’t hurt the story aspect that the game pieces are named after military entities

at a tournament i want to tell my opponent the saddest story s/he’s ever heard, and have him/her believe every word of it
