a woman whose eyewitness testimony wrongly put a man in prison for the past 17 yrs is meeting the exonerated inmate face to face for the first time. Unable to live with the guilt, she needs to face him. To beg his forgiveness.

She looks him in the eyes, she breaks down in tears. The newly freed man smiles and wraps her in a warm embrace.

“Thank you”, he says.
