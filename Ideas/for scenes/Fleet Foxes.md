A scene based on that one with Jess about Fleet Foxes.

  

_…song ends…_

“before you say anything, i just had a conversation with you in my head.”

“oh yeah?”

“yeah, you said something like ‘how are they better than Imagine Dragons? How are they even all that _different_? Then I said something like ‘well you just don’t understand songwriting structure I mean, Fleet Foxes basically recreated the raw folk-rock sound of the sixties with the perfect indie rock tweaks’. Then you were like ‘couldn’t the same thing be said about Imagine Dragons? Their sound is basically pop with a tweak of indie rock. Isn’t that still a value-added scenario?’, and I’ve got to say, you make a damned good point.”

“Damn right.”

  

that’d be a cute scene
