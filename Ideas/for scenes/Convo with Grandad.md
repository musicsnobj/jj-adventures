i can cite the behave book talking to my grandad

i can tell him how i've found it more useful to study science rhan political science

i saw my grandad, my own flesh and blood, forwarding all these hateful lies about the president and i thought..is he an evil man?

i really hoped to understand

sure, we love hearing nasty things about the 'thems' we don't like

my seed is swelling

i am breaking bad

bad persion

terrible person

i love and miss jess

one behavior we all are predisposed to is fantasy. to think of ourselves as being the hero of our own story, part of a larger, cosmically relevant cause.

that's why we as a species love stories, especially those with a clearly defined hero and villain. it's why we invented sports, novels, films, tv shows.

an important part of that is separating the heros from the villains

we need to have our own villain. our nemesis that threatens our existence, goliath to our david.

another thing we get through our genes is racism. well, in so many words, a predisposition to classify people of a different color as a 'them'. a villain. up to no good. plotting for the destruction of my family and our christian values. must be stopped

cable news evolved organically because people were pining for the chance to live in a perpetual narrative. good news about the good guys. bad news about the bad guys. the type of news that causes a release of oxytocin in your brain, same one you get when your favorite sports team defeats its rival.

but the reason the fox narrative has more viewers than all the other cable news narratives combined is because of the racism gene.

in other words, my grandad does not forward these hateful emails because he is a bad person. he is just a very dumb person

and that's not necessarily a bad thing. you've obviously done well for yourself even coming up in hard circumstances i could not begin to understand

but

because a college education was never necessary for your survival as it is for mine today, i can say the word gene and you just don't know what i'm talking about

i could talk all day about genetic predispositions and all the while you're thinking what fox and friends programmed you to think at all times. but what about hillary and what about obama and what about franken etc...

other than what you learned through job training, you don't know a whole lot about science in general. and that's ok. it's STILL not necessary for your survival. you get up and do what we all do. chase the next release of oxytocin, seratonin, whatever happy chemical your brain is expecting this time of day. for you it might be a warm shower, a hot breakfast, then some bad news about the villain you love to hate or the hero you love to love.

i'm not here to rob you of your chemical rush

i'm not going to change your behavior at your age, and with how much we've grown apart i have really no authority to make you change your behavior.

all i ask is that you please please stop making the ludicrous assertion that the "science" you get in your spam folder, which is designed to give you that morning oxytocin rush, is of a higher authority than actual science.

pompous as it sounds, my fortunate exposure to education, which i believe you were always an advocate of, is what separates my science from your science. mine is true whether it gives me a happy chemical rush or not. but i'm still a creature just like you. i get my hero villain chemical rush by architecting statements like this and hurling them at villains like you.

  

holy shit. i've been writing a story scene this whole time. doesn't get more personal than this!

there. i did something other than masturbate today
