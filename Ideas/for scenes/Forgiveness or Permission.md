just realized that awkward convo w/ michelle a few yrs ago re: her comfort with my asking her friend out could be a good scene introducing the mind reader character

which i also just came up with…sort of

that youmirror technology i was playing with which is a digital representation of a person’s decision engine

  

omg i also figured out the _trigger_! the thing that adds the extra point zero zero some-odd psi to the situation to make the dam bust wide open

the youmirror (or a better, less derivative name?) organiztion has been hacked!

millions of users’ digital neural networks have been compromised

victims obviously can’t just change their name or get a new ssn. this information is the digital replica of the myriad of synaptic connections, myelinated and re-myelinated by years of exposure to all the world’s stimuli. it’s engrained in their biochemistry, and now some unknown hacker has all that info

the possibilities are endless

illegal underground services pop up

new businesses started. a service that can tell you exactly what you need to say to get a girl into bed (provided your target was one of the 63% of compromised youmirror users)

  

anyway, the michelle scene. it won’t be michelle. and she and jack aren’t friends. let’s call them ellen and derrick

ellen’s heard terrible rumors about derrick and his treatment of women, and also his inexplicable success getting them into bed

ellen’s seen her little sister krissy talking to derrick, maybe he’s just moved into their apt building or something

nah it doesn’t make sense if ellen and derrick don’t already have some kind of relationship. why would derrick bother seeking her blessing?

in a nutshell, i picture ellen giving a response something like michelle’s actual response (i.e. - i wouldn’t realyl be comfortable with that) or maybe something genuinely aggressive (e.g. - ‘go near her and i will cut your dick off’)

derrick’s does NOT respond the way i did though…

Hmmm…well this is a bit awkward. As it happens that concert was last week and…we’ve already hooked up several times and…to be honest i don’t really much care whether you approve or not. i was just hoping this would go the other way so i could _have done…sort of_…the right thing?
